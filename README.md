Add pricing tables to WPCasa using a shortcode. When this plugin is activated a new post type for pricing tables will be created. Through a set of custom meta boxes you can add your pricing tables with different plans and use a shortcode to display the table on your WPCasa website. Please find more information at [wpcasa.com](https://wpcasa.com/downloads/wpcasa-pricing-tables/).

**Please Notice!** This is an extension plugin and only works in combination with the [WPCasa Real Estate WordPress](https://github.com/wpsight/wpcasa) plugin.
